## Description
Here I have made a simple README.md generator, just answer the provided questions and this project will turn your answers into a README.md file.

## Motivation
The motive was to create a project that will help me in the future and will also save me a lot of time. Also while using this in future projects I will have more consistant README.md files.

## Solutions
One problem I have had is inconsistant README.md files. some short and some longer. This generator will provent that in the future.

## What I Learned
In this project I have learned how to use JavaScript to generate a type of file I can use.

## What Makes It Different
This project stand out by not having t manually create a README.md file from scratch.
