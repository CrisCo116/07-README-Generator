# Professional README Generator Starter Code

# README.md Generator
  
  ## Description
  Here I have made a simple README.md generator, just answer the provided questions and this project will turn your answers into a README.md file.
  
  ## Motivation
  The motive was to create a project that will help me in the future and will also save me a lot of time. Also while using this in future projects I will have more consistant README.md files.

  ## Solutions
  One problem I have had is inconsistant README.md files. some short and some longer. This generator will provent that in the future.

  ## What I learned
  In this project I have learned how to use JavaScript to generate a type of file I can use.

  ## What makes it different
  This project stand out by not having t manually create a README.md file from scratch.
